In this project, Iâ€™ll be continuing to develop the backend for the file sharing site to continue the proceedings of the project â€˜File System Encryption using AES-256 over HTTPSâ€™.

This involves the HTTPS part of the other project, I had already set up a domain with a free and custom TLD, I also enabled SSL certificate to make the site HTTPS. This was all done in **InfinityFree**.

```
https://www.infinityfree.com/
```

a free web-hosting site that makes development of a website much simpler with free of cost, the only thing that could be even considered as a downside is the custom and the relatively unknown TLD (Top-level Domains).

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ TLD stands for Top-level Domains. These are the highest level of domains in the hierarchical Domain Name System (DNS) of the internet. Examples of TLDs include .com, .org, .net, and .gov

Before I start the documentation of this project, let me leave the link to my domain below.
